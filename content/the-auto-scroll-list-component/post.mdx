## How it started

[Skip the story](#requirement)

On Nov 20, 2024, I discovered this post by [@TkDodo](https://x.com/TkDodo).

<Tweet id='1859260272105435210' />

It's a pretty interesting thread, and the answer to all the questions involving the `useRef` + `useEffect` combination for imperative DOM manipulation is to use [Callback Refs](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/avoiding-use-effect-with-callback-refs).

I had the same use case: implementing auto-scroll to the bottom for my RAG chatbot [zoro](/bot). However, one gotcha with callback refs is that, unlike `useEffect`, we can't return a cleanup function. Instead, when the component unmounts from the DOM, the callback ref will be called with a `null` value, which you can check to perform the cleanup. This felt a bit cumbersome to me.

Luckily, [React 19 fixes this](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19#cleanup-functions-for-refs). With React 19, we can return a cleanup function that behaves exactly like the cleanup function of `useEffect`.

Since everything was in my favor, I gave this approach a shot‚Äîand I loved it instantly. I also added one more behavior apart from my initial implementation: respecting user interaction and pausing the auto-scroll behavior. This idea was taught by [@samselikoff](https://x.com/samselikoff) in [Distinguishing Between Human and Programmatic Scrolling](https://youtu.be/3saFasHrnEg?si=rmRvuAZz9-9gHk2N). I [posted](https://x.com/_nikhilsnayak_/status/1859548189235524010) this approach on ùïè, and, just like me, many React devs seemed to like it.

So, let's build `AutoScrollList` from scratch! I recommend going through the resources linked above to better understand this post.

---

## Requirement

First, let's understand the end goal. We need a component that automatically scrolls to the bottom whenever the content in the list changes‚Äîfor example, when a new list item is added or an existing list item is updated. Additionally, we need to respect user interaction with the interface. If the user scrolls upward, the auto-scroll behavior should pause. However, if they scroll downward again, the auto-scroll behavior should resume.

Here is the Chat UI that we will be enhancing:

<CodeBlock>  
<Snippet>

```tsx lineNumbers filename="App.tsx"
import { AssistantMessage, UserMessage } from './message';
import { useContinueConversation } from './use-continue-conversation';
import { UserInput } from './user-input';

export default function App() {
  const { messages, continueConversation, isPending } =
    useContinueConversation();

  return (
    <div>
      <ul className='mb-4 h-[50vh] space-y-4 overflow-auto p-4'>
        {messages.map((message) => {
          return (
            <li key={message.id}>
              {message.role === 'assistant' ? (
                <AssistantMessage>{message.value}</AssistantMessage>
              ) : (
                <UserMessage>{message.value}</UserMessage>
              )}
            </li>
          );
        })}
      </ul>
      <UserInput action={continueConversation} isPending={isPending} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Snippet>  
<Preview>  
<ChatUI />  
</Preview>  
</CodeBlock>

> You don't need to worry about any of the implementation details in the code above. It's just the boilerplate to help us get started with our scroll component. This is a simulated generative AI chat interface.

The `messages` array holds all the data, and we map each message into either `AssistantMessage` or `UserMessage` accordingly. Currently, the Chat UI doesn't have any auto-scroll behavior.

With all the housekeeping out of the way, let's dive into the fun part!

---

## Version 1 (My Initial Implementation)

There are many ways to address our requirement. One approach is to add a `useEffect` with `messages` as a dependency, so that whenever the messages change, we trigger auto-scrolling. However, we‚Äôll take a different route by using `MutationObserver` to listen for DOM mutations and trigger the scroll behavior.

Let‚Äôs modify the `ChatUI` component and walk through the implementation:

<CodeBlock>  
<Snippet>

```tsx lineNumbers filename="App.tsx" addition="1,11-28,33" deletion="32"
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

import { AssistantMessage, UserMessage } from './message';
import { useContinueConversation } from './use-continue-conversation';
import { UserInput } from './user-input';

export default function App() {
  const { messages, continueConversation, isPending } =
    useContinueConversation();

  const autoScrollListRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const list = autoScrollListRef.current;
    if (!list) return;

    const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
      list.scrollTo({ top: list.scrollHeight });
    });

    observer.observe(list, {
      subtree: true,
      childList: true,
      characterData: true,
    });

    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <ul className='mb-4 h-[50vh] space-y-4 overflow-auto p-4'>
      <ul ref={autoScrollListRef} className='mb-4 h-[50vh] space-y-4 overflow-y-auto p-4'>
        {messages.map((message) => {
          return (
            <li key={message.id}>
              {message.role === 'assistant' ? (
                <AssistantMessage>{message.value}</AssistantMessage>
              ) : (
                <UserMessage>{message.value}</UserMessage>
              )}
            </li>
          );
        })}
      </ul>
      <UserInput action={continueConversation} isPending={isPending} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Snippet>  
<Preview>  
<V1 />  
</Preview>  
</CodeBlock>

We‚Äôve attached a `ref` (`autoScrollListRef`) to the `ul` element. It‚Äôs important that the `ul` element has a fixed height, and `overflow-y` is set to either `auto` or `scroll`. All the scrolling magic happens inside the `useEffect`.

Here‚Äôs what happens:

- We set up a `MutationObserver` with a callback to scroll the list to the bottom.
- The observer is configured to watch for mutations to the `ul` element extracted from the `autoScrollListRef` using the following options:

  ```ts
  const options = {
    childList: true,
    subtree: true,
    characterData: true,
  };
  ```

  - Setting `childList` to `true` ensures the target observes changes to its immediate children. For example, when a new message is added, the callback fires, and the scroll behavior is triggered.
  - Setting `subtree` to `true` ensures the target observes its descendants as well. This is necessary because responses from the LLM are streamed and may contain markdown. Whenever a mutation occurs in a descendant, the callback is triggered to handle auto-scrolling.
  - Setting `characterData` to `true` ensures that changes to `textContent` also trigger the callback, enabling auto-scroll even for minor content updates.

This approach works, but it has a major issue: it doesn‚Äôt respect user interactions. If a user scrolls up, auto-scroll will still force the view to the bottom, which can be frustrating. Additionally, we‚Äôre using the `useRef` + `useEffect` combination for imperative DOM manipulation, which is a good sign to use Callback Ref.

You can learn more about why callback refs are better from the article linked above.

Let‚Äôs fix these issues in the next version.

## Version 2 (Callback Ref + Pausing Auto-Scroll Behavior)

Now that we understand how the `ChatUI` works, let‚Äôs focus on building the core part of the auto-scroll behavior in the `AutoScrollList` component.

<CodeBlock>  
<Snippet>

```tsx lineNumbers filename="AutoScrollList.tsx" highlight="4,6-23,25-37"
import { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

export function AutoScrollList({ className, ...rest }) {
  const [shouldAutoScroll, setShouldAutoScroll] = useState(true);

  const autoScrollListRef = useCallback(
    (list) => {
      const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
        if (shouldAutoScroll) {
          list.scrollTo({ top: list.scrollHeight });
        }
      });

      observer.observe(list, {
        subtree: true,
        childList: true,
        characterData: true,
      });

      return () => observer.disconnect();
    },
    [shouldAutoScroll]
  );

  const handleUserInteraction = (e) => {
    const { scrollHeight, clientHeight, scrollTop } = e.currentTarget;
    const maxScrollHeight = scrollHeight - clientHeight;

    if (e.deltaY < 0) {
      setShouldAutoScroll(false);
    } else if (
      e.deltaY > 0 &&
      maxScrollHeight - scrollTop <= maxScrollHeight / 2
    ) {
      setShouldAutoScroll(true);
    }
  };

  return (
    <ul
      ref={autoScrollListRef}
      className={`overflow-y-auto ${className}`}
      onWheel={handleUserInteraction}
      {...rest}
    />
  );
}
```

</Snippet>

<V2 />  
</Preview>  
</CodeBlock>

### Callback Ref for DOM Access

In lines 6‚Äì23, the auto-scroll logic remains almost the same as before, except it now respects the `shouldAutoScroll` state. The major difference is the use of **callback refs** instead of `useRef` and `useEffect`.

With callback refs:

- The `MutationObserver` is set up directly when the `ul` element is mounted.
- This eliminates the need for `useEffect` to handle imperative DOM manipulation.

The `useCallback` wrapper around `autoScrollListRef` ensures the callback is not recreated on every render. This is critical because callback refs depend on referential equality; recreating them unnecessarily could lead to repeated execution.

In contrast, with the `useRef` + `useEffect` approach, the `MutationObserver` setup happens when the `AutoScrollList` component is mounted‚Äînot when the DOM node is available. This subtle distinction makes callback refs cleaner and more efficient in this case.

For a deeper dive into why callback refs are preferable here, check out this excellent [article](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/avoiding-use-effect-with-callback-refs).

### Respecting User Interaction

To handle user interaction and pause auto-scroll when needed, we use the `wheel` event, as taught by [@samselikoff](https://x.com/samselikoff) in [Distinguishing Between Human and Programmatic Scrolling](https://youtu.be/3saFasHrnEg?si=rmRvuAZz9-9gHk2N).

Here‚Äôs how the `handleUserInteraction` function works:

- **On scroll up (`e.deltaY < 0`)**: The user is scrolling upward, so we disable auto-scroll by setting `shouldAutoScroll` to `false`.
- **On scroll down (`e.deltaY > 0`)**: If the user scrolls downward and is close to the bottom (within half the maximum scroll height), auto-scroll is re-enabled by setting `shouldAutoScroll` to `true`.

The `shouldAutoScroll` state is included in the dependency array of the `useCallback`, ensuring that the callback ref is updated whenever the state changes, keeping the behavior consistent.

While this version addresses some key issues, it introduces two challenges:

1. **Memoization Issues**  
   Relying on memoization for correctness may cause unexpected behavior, particularly with the React Compiler. For more insights, check out this [thread](https://bsky.app/profile/gsathya.bsky.social/post/3lbjpdhqxzk24).

2. **Lack of Mobile Support**  
   The `wheel` event doesn‚Äôt fire on touch devices. This means the `handleUserInteraction` callback won‚Äôt work on mobile, leaving those interactions unhandled.

Let‚Äôs address these issues in the final version to build a robust and versatile `AutoScrollList` component! üöÄ

## Version 3 (The Endgame)

With this version, you don't need `useCallback` or `useState` because we are stepping outside of the React world and hand-rolling everything with vanilla DOM APIs like a caveman. The `AutoScrollList` component itself is a React component, but the logic for controlling the scroll behavior is implemented outside of React. Let's look at the code and discuss what we have changed.

<CodeBlock>  
<Snippet>

```tsx lineNumbers filename="AutoScrollList.tsx" highlight="11-77"
export function AutoScrollList({ className, ...rest }) {
  return (
    <ul
      ref={autoScrollListRef}
      className={`overflow-y-auto ${className}`}
      {...rest}
    />
  );
}

function autoScrollListRef(list: HTMLUListElement) {
  let shouldAutoScroll = true;
  let touchStartY = 0;
  let lastScrollTop = 0;

  const checkScrollPosition = () => {
    const { scrollHeight, clientHeight, scrollTop } = list;
    const maxScrollHeight = scrollHeight - clientHeight;
    const scrollThreshold = maxScrollHeight / 2;

    if (scrollTop < lastScrollTop) {
      shouldAutoScroll = false;
    } else if (maxScrollHeight - scrollTop <= scrollThreshold) {
      shouldAutoScroll = true;
    }

    lastScrollTop = scrollTop;
  };

  const handleWheel = (e: WheelEvent) => {
    if (e.deltaY < 0) {
      shouldAutoScroll = false;
    } else {
      checkScrollPosition();
    }
  };

  const handleTouchStart = (e: TouchEvent) => {
    touchStartY = e.touches[0].clientY;
  };

  const handleTouchMove = (e: TouchEvent) => {
    const touchEndY = e.touches[0].clientY;
    const deltaY = touchStartY - touchEndY;

    if (deltaY < 0) {
      shouldAutoScroll = false;
    } else {
      checkScrollPosition();
    }

    touchStartY = touchEndY;
  };

  list.addEventListener('wheel', handleWheel);
  list.addEventListener('touchstart', handleTouchStart);
  list.addEventListener('touchmove', handleTouchMove);

  const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
    if (shouldAutoScroll) {
      list.scrollTo({ top: list.scrollHeight });
    }
  });

  observer.observe(list, {
    childList: true,
    subtree: true,
    characterData: true,
  });

  return () => {
    observer.disconnect();
    list.removeEventListener('wheel', handleWheel);
    list.removeEventListener('touchstart', handleTouchStart);
    list.removeEventListener('touchmove', handleTouchMove);
  };
}
```

</Snippet>  
<Preview>  
<V3 />  
</Preview>  
</CodeBlock>

1. The `autoScrollListRef` function is now scoped outside the `AutoScrollList` component, which eliminates concerns about referential stability. This change removes the need for `useCallback` and avoids unnecessary re-creation of the callback ref during re-renders.

2. Since this approach operates outside the React world, we use a simple variable `shouldAutoScroll` instead of React state. This eliminates the need for `useState` and avoids unnecessary state re-renders, making the logic more lightweight.

3. To handle touch devices, we utilize the `touchmove` event. Unlike the `wheel` event, the `touchmove` event does not provide a `deltaY` value for determining the scroll direction. Instead, we calculate it manually by listening to the `touchstart` event and applying straightforward logic.

Give it a try in the **Preview** tab, and let me know what you think of this approach! üòä

## Conclusion

In this journey of building the `AutoScrollList` component, we explored multiple approaches, starting with a basic `useRef` and `useEffect` combination, progressing to `useCallback` with improved handling of user interactions, and finally settling on a robust vanilla DOM-based solution. Each iteration addressed limitations and improved functionality, with the final version offering better performance, simplicity, and cross-device compatibility.

By understanding the trade-offs and leveraging the right tools for the job, we created a highly efficient and user-friendly auto-scroll behavior that respects user interactions. Whether you‚Äôre building a chat UI or any dynamic content list, this approach ensures a smooth and seamless user experience.
